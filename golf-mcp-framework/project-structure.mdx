GolfMCP uses a convention-based project structure.

```
<project-root>/
├── golf.json
├── auth.py               # Authentication configuration (v0.2.0)

```

*   **`golf.json`**: The main configuration file (see [Configuration](/golf-mcp-framework/configuration)).
*   **`auth.py`**: Dedicated authentication configuration file (see [Authentication](/golf-mcp-framework/authentication)).
*   **`tools/`**: Contains Python files defining your server's tools (see [Component Specification](/golf-mcp-framework/component-specification)).
*   **`resources/`**: Contains Python files defining data resources the LLM can read (see [Component Specification](/golf-mcp-framework/component-specification)).
*   **`prompts/`**: Contains Python files defining reusable prompt templates (see [Component Specification](/golf-mcp-framework/component-specification)).

<Note>
  **Deprecated:** Authentication configuration in `pre_build.py` is deprecated. Use the dedicated `auth.py` file instead for cleaner organization and better maintainability.
</Note>

### Component Discovery

*   Each `.py` file within `tools/`, `resources/`, or `prompts/` (and their subdirectories) is treated as a single component.
*   Files named `__init__.py` are ignored for direct component definition but are essential for Python's packaging if you structure your components as modules.
*   Files named `common.py` are special and used for shared code (see [Shared Logic documentation](/golf-mcp-framework/shared-logic-common-py)).
*   The `auth.py` file is treated specially for authentication configuration and is not considered a component.

### Component ID Derivation

The unique ID for each component is derived from its file path relative to the category directory (`tools`, `resources`, `prompts`).

**Examples:**

*   `tools/hello.py`                 -> ID: `hello`
*   `tools/payments/transaction/submit.py` -> ID: `submit-transaction-payments`
*   `resources/weather/current.py`   -> ID: `current-weather`

ID collisions will result in a build-time error.

## Authentication Configuration

### The `auth.py` File (New in v0.2.0)

Golf v0.2.0 introduces a dedicated `auth.py` file for authentication configuration, providing better organization and cleaner separation from other build logic.

**Example `auth.py` configurations** (for full details, see [Authentication](/golf-mcp-framework/authentication)):

```python
# auth.py - API Key Authentication
from golf.auth import configure_api_key

configure_api_key(
    header_name="Authorization",
    header_prefix="Bearer "
)
```

```python
# auth.py - JWT Authentication
from golf.auth import configure_jwt_auth

configure_jwt_auth(
    jwks_uri_env_var="JWKS_URI",
    issuer_env_var="JWT_ISSUER",
    audience_env_var="JWT_AUDIENCE",
    required_scopes=["read:user"]
)
```

```python
# auth.py - Development Authentication
from golf.auth import configure_dev_auth

configure_dev_auth(
    tokens={
        "dev-token-123": {
            "client_id": "dev-client",
            "scopes": ["read", "write"]
        }
    },
    required_scopes=["read"]
)
```
