GolfMCP uses a convention-based project structure.

```
<project-root>/
├── .env
├── golf.json
├── pre_build.py
├── prompts/
│   └── example_prompt.py
├── resources/
│   └── example_resource.py
│   └── sub_category/
│       └── nested_resource.py
│       └── common.py
└── tools/
    └── example_tool.py
    └── payments/
        └── common.py
        └── get_balance.py
        └── transaction/
            └── submit.py
```

*   **`golf.json`**: The main configuration file (see Configuration section).
*   **`.env`**: Stores environment variables. Loaded by the built server.
*   **`pre_build.py`**: Optional script for pre-build tasks, like auth setup.
*   **`tools/`**: Contains Python files defining your server's tools (callable functions).
*   **`resources/`**: Contains Python files defining data resources the LLM can read.
*   **`prompts/`**: Contains Python files defining reusable prompt templates.

### Component Discovery

*   Each `.py` file within `tools/`, `resources/`, or `prompts/` (and their subdirectories) is treated as a single component.
*   Files named `__init__.py` are ignored for direct component definition but are essential for Python's packaging if you structure your components as modules.
*   Files named `common.py` are special and used for shared code (see `common.py` section).

### Component ID Derivation

The unique ID for each component (used for registration in FastMCP) is derived from its file path relative to the category directory (`tools`, `resources`, `prompts`).

**Algorithm:**
Given a component file: `<project-root>/<category>/<p1>/.../<pn>/<filename>.py`
Let `PathRev = [pn, ..., p1]` (reversed list of parent directories under the category).
The ID is: `<filename>` + (`"-"` + `"-".join(PathRev)` if `PathRev` is not empty, otherwise `""`)

**Examples:**

*   `tools/hello.py`                 -> ID: `hello`
*   `tools/payments/transaction/submit.py` -> ID: `submit-transaction-payments`
*   `resources/weather/current.py`   -> ID: `current-weather`

Filename is taken without the `.py` extension. Case is preserved. ID collisions will result in a build-time error.
