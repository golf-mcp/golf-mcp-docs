The `golf` command-line interface is your primary tool for managing GolfMCP projects.

## Commands

### `golf init`

Initializes a new GolfMCP project directory with Golf branding and modern authentication setup.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic
golf init my_awesome_server
```

```bash With options
golf init my-api-project --output-dir ./projects
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="project_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the project and the directory to be created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output-dir" type="string">
  Specifies a different directory to create the project in. Defaults to a new directory named `project_name` in the current location.
  
  Alias: `-o`
</ParamField>


### `golf build`

Builds your GolfMCP project into a runnable MCP server. The build process includes enhanced authentication handling and validation.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Development
golf build dev
```

```bash Production
golf build prod
```
</CodeGroup>

The build environment parameter is required and must be either `dev` or `prod`:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Development (`dev`)</th>
      <th>Production (`prod`)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        • Copies `.env` file to `dist/` directory<br/>
        • Environment variables loaded from local file<br/>
        • Optimized for local development and testing
      </td>
      <td>
        • No `.env` file copied<br/>
        • Environment variables expected at runtime<br/>
        • Optimized for production deployment
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### `golf run`

Runs a previously built GolfMCP server with enhanced runtime features.

```bash
golf run
```


<Note>
  Make sure to run `golf build` before using `golf run`.
