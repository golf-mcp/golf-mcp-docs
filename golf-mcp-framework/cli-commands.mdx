The `golf` command-line interface is your primary tool for managing GolfMCP projects.

## Commands

### `golf init`

Initializes a new GolfMCP project directory with Golf branding and modern authentication setup.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic
golf init my_awesome_server
```

```bash With options
golf init my-api-project --output-dir ./projects
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="project_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the project and the directory to be created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output-dir" type="string">
  Specifies a different directory to create the project in. Defaults to a new directory named `project_name` in the current location.
  
  Alias: `-o`
</ParamField>


### `golf build`

Builds your GolfMCP project into a runnable MCP server. The build process now includes enhanced authentication handling and validation.

**New in v0.2.0:**
- Uses dedicated `auth.py` file for authentication configuration
- Validates authentication configuration and setup
- Provides clearer error messages for authentication setup issues
- Better environment variable validation at build time

<CodeGroup>
```bash Development
golf build dev
```

```bash Production
golf build prod
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="env" type="string" required>
  The build environment. Must be either `dev` or `prod`.
  
  - **`dev`**: Creates a development build. Copies the `.env` file from your project root to the output directory (`dist/`) so the server can access environment variables during local development.
  - **`prod`**: Creates a production build. Environment variables are expected to be set in the production environment itself, so `.env` is not copied.
</ParamField>

### `golf run`

Runs a previously built GolfMCP server with enhanced runtime features.

```bash
golf run
```

**New in v0.2.0:**
- More secure environment variable loading
- Better authentication error reporting  
- Standards-compliant auth endpoints
- Automatic Golf Platform telemetry when `GOLF_API_KEY` is present

<Note>
  Make sure to run `golf build` before using `golf run`. The command executes the server from the `dist/` directory.
</Note>

## Enhanced Features in v0.2.0

### Project Initialization

The `golf init` command now provides:

- **Golf Branding**: ASCII logo and enhanced visual output during initialization
- **Simplified Structure**: No more complex template selection
- **Modern Authentication**: Automatic setup for current authentication methods
- **Clean Output**: Improved messaging and user experience

### Build Process

The `golf build` command includes:

- **Authentication Configuration**: Uses dedicated `auth.py` file for authentication setup
- **Configuration Validation**: Detects and reports authentication setup issues
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear guidance for fixing configuration issues
- **Environment Validation**: Verifies required environment variables at build time

### Runtime Features

The `golf run` command provides:

- **Secure Loading**: Improved environment variable handling
- **Better Diagnostics**: Enhanced error reporting and logging
- **Platform Integration**: Automatic telemetry with Golf Platform
- **Standards Compliance**: FastMCP authentication providers

## Command Examples

### Creating a New Project

```bash
# Create project with Golf branding
golf init my-awesome-server

# Create in specific directory
golf init payment-tools --output-dir ./projects
```

### Building for Different Environments

```bash
# Development build (includes .env file)
golf build dev

# Production build (environment variables expected at runtime)
golf build prod
```

### Running with Golf Platform

```bash
# Set Golf Platform API key for enhanced telemetry
export GOLF_API_KEY=your-platform-key
golf run
```
