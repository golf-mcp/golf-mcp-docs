The `golf` command-line interface is your primary tool for managing GolfMCP projects.

### `golf init`

Initializes a new GolfMCP project directory.

```bash
golf init <project_name> [options]
```
*   **`project_name`**: (Required) The name of the project and the directory to be created.
*   **`--output-dir <path>`, `-o <path>`**: Specifies a different directory to create the project in. Defaults to a new directory named `project_name` in the current location.
*   **`--template <template_name>`**: Use a specific project template. Available templates:
    *   `default` - Standard GolfMCP project with example components
    *   `api_key` - Project pre-configured with API key authentication

Example:
```bash
# Create a project with API key authentication
golf init my-api-project --template api_key
```

### `golf build <env>`

Builds your GolfMCP project into a runnable MCP Server

```bash
golf build dev|prod [options]
```
*   **`dev`**: Creates a development build. Typically copies the `.env` file from your project root to the output directory (`dist/`) so the server can access environment variables during local development.
*   **`prod`**: Creates a production build. Environment variables are generally expected to be set in the production environment itself, so `.env` is not copied.

### `golf run`

Runs a previously built GolfMCP server.

```bash
golf run [options]
```
