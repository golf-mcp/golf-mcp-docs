The `golf` command-line interface is your primary tool for managing GolfMCP projects.

## Commands

### `golf init`

Initializes a new GolfMCP project directory.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic
golf init my_awesome_server
```

```bash With options
golf init my-api-project --template api_key --output-dir ./projects
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="project_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the project and the directory to be created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--output-dir" type="string">
  Specifies a different directory to create the project in. Defaults to a new directory named `project_name` in the current location.
  
  Alias: `-o`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--template" type="string">
  Use a specific project template.
  
  Available templates:
  - `default` - Standard GolfMCP project with example components
  - `api_key` - Project pre-configured with API key authentication
</ParamField>

### `golf build`

Builds your GolfMCP project into a runnable MCP server.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Development
golf build dev
```

```bash Production
golf build prod
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="env" type="string" required>
  The build environment. Must be either `dev` or `prod`.
  
  - **`dev`**: Creates a development build. Copies the `.env` file from your project root to the output directory (`dist/`) so the server can access environment variables during local development.
  - **`prod`**: Creates a production build. Environment variables are expected to be set in the production environment itself, so `.env` is not copied.
</ParamField>

### `golf run`

Runs a previously built GolfMCP server.

```bash
golf run
```

<Note>
  Make sure to run `golf build` before using `golf run`. The command executes the server from the `dist/` directory.
