Here are the things we are working hard on:

*   **Native OpenTelemetry implementation for tracing**
*   **`golf deploy` command for one click deployments to Vercel, Blaxel and other providers**
*   **Production-ready OAuth token management, to allow for persistent, encrypted token storage and client mapping**
