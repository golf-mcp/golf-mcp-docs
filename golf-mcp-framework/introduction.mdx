GolfMCP is a framework designed to simplify the development of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It allows you to define tools, resources, and prompts as simple Python files. GolfMCP then discovers these components and compiles them into a runnable MCP server with minimal boilerplate.

The core philosophy is to let you focus on the logic of your components, while Golf handles the complexities of MCP server setup, authentication and telemetry.
